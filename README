EasyTableView 2.0 - January 6, 2016

IMPORTANT NOTE: The API for EasyTableView has changed of January 6, 2016. So if you have been a consumer of EasyTableView prior to this date, you may find that this update breaks your existing projects. 


SUMMARY
=======

This project demonstrates the use of the EasyTableView class. The demo is intended to be run on an iPad only, but there is no reason why EasyTableView could not be used on an iPhone.

To use EasyTableView in your own project, all you need to include are the following files:

EasyTableView.h
EasyTableView.m


DESCRIPTION
===========

EasyTableView was created to address two concerns. The first is the ability to have a table view, horizontal or vertical, that only partially fills the screen. Normally one would use UITableViewController but as per Apple documentation, that requires table views that fill the whole screen. EasyTableView addresses this problem by acting as the controller for the embedded table view, and exposes a subset of table view functionality with it's own delegate methods.
 
The second concern addressed by EasyTableView is horizontal table views. Table views were initially designed to be vertical only. EasyTableView solves this problem by rotating the table view, and then reverse rotating table view cells. One could also provide horizontally scrolling table views by subclassing UIScrollView, but I wanted to create one simple, common interface for creating both vertical EasyTableViews and horizontal EasyTableViews.
 
So now you can create simple partial screen table views, either vertically or horizontally, all with the same interface.


CHANGES
=======

JANUARY 6, 2016 - Version 2.0
Updated for iOS 9. Interface simplified. A demonstration of use with storyboards is now included.

JANUARY 10, 2013 - Version 1.1
Updated for iOS 6. Also added new setScrollFraction method added which will scroll the table view to a fraction of the total scroll length.

MARCH 5, 2012
Updated to support ARC. EasyTableView now requires ARC.

MARCH 1, 2012
Whereas before EasyTableView was implemented to work with only one table view section, it has now been generalized to work with multiple table view sections. It also now supports section headers and footers. If you would like too see the demo run using just a single table view section, comment out the following line in EasyTableViewController.m:

	#define SHOW_MULTIPLE_SECTIONS	1

JANUARY 31, 2012
The sample project has been updated with a comprehensive example that demonstrates the use of EasyTableView with public images loaded from the Flickr website. Tap the info button to see that example in action. If you get an error, please tap Done and try again. The use of EasyTableView with remote images is implemented in FlipsideViewController.


KNOWN LIMITATIONS
=================
 
1. A horizontal EasyTableView will correctly auto-resize it's overall length. However a horizontal EasyTableView will NOT necessarily correctly auto-resize it's height.

2. Loading the Flickr catalog will sometimes fail due to JSON parsing errors. 


USAGE
=====

To understand how to use EasyTableView, study the code in EasyTableViewController.m or FlipsideViewController.m. To create a new EasyTableView object, look at the methods (void)setupHorizontalView and (void)setupVerticalView. As seen in the source code, you initialize a vertical scrolling table view with:

- (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame ofHeight:(CGFloat)cellHeight;

To initialize a horizontal scrolling table view use:

- (id)initWithFrame:(CGRect)frame ofWidth:(CGFloat)cellWidth;

There are only two delegate methods that must always be implemented as part of the EasyTableViewDelegate protocol:

- (NSInteger)easyTableView:(EasyTableView *)easyTableView numberOfRowsInSection:(NSInteger)section {
- (UITableViewCell *)easyTableView:(EasyTableView *)easyTableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath

If you plan to setup an EasyTableView with multiple sections, you must implement the following delegate method:

- (NSUInteger)numberOfSectionsInEasyTableView:(EasyTableView*)easyTableView;

That's all there is to it. It is very easy to use. And yes, that is a picture of my tent!
